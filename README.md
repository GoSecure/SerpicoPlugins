# SerpicoPlugins
This repository includes plugins for Serpico. The [wiki](https://github.com/SerpicoProject/SerpicoPlugins/wiki/Main-Page) has more information on how to build plug-ins.


Plug-ins are ideally suited to (a) add functionality that involves third party components or (b) proto-typing functionality.
